h1. concordion-extensions

Contains 3 "Concordion":http://concordion.org extensions. These require the new extension mechanism in Concordion. (This is currently in the nigel-charman branch of the Concordion - you'll need to check out this branch and build it).

To install all 3 extensions, set the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.Extensions</code>, or see the individual extensions for installation details.  To install more than 1 extension, supply a comma-separated list of extensions in the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property.

h2. LoggingTooltipExtension

Annotates the Concordion HTML output with logging information. 

See "my blog":http://tutansblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/whats-happening-in-my-acceptance-tests.html for details and screenshots.

Currently the code is at a "Proof of Concept" stage, and any feedback is welcome.

Thanks to Trent Richardson for the "CSS Tooltip":http://trentrichardson.com/examples/csstooltips/ implementation.

This extension captures java.util.logging output. (It would probably benefit from some configuration options - feel free to provide feedback!)

This extension is installed by setting the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.LoggingTooltipExtension</code>.

h2. ScreenshotOnFailureExtension

On failure of any Concordion assertion, this adds a screenshot to the output HTML.  The screenshot is displayed when you hover over the red failure text. 

This currently uses java.awt.Robot to capture the screenshot.  We plan to allow pluggable mechanisms for screenshots, for example using the WebDriver TakesScreenshot interface to allow specific windows to be captured.

This extension is installed by setting the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.ScreenshotOnFailureExtension</code>.

h2. TimestampFormatterExtension

A simple extension that reformats the milliseconds in the footer of the Concordion output to show hours, minutes and seconds. 

This extension is installed by setting the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.TimestampFormatterExtension</code>.
