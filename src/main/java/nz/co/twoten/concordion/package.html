 <p>
This package contains extensions to:
<ol>
    <li>embed logging information in the Concordion output</li>
    <li>embed screenshots in the Concordion output</li>
    <li>change the timestamp in the footer of the Concordion output from milliseconds to hours, minutes and seconds</li>
</ol>
<p>To add all of the extensions, set the system property <code>concordion.extensions</code> to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.Extensions</code>.
This is typically set in the &#064;BeforeClass of a base test case:</p> 
<pre>
    &#064;BeforeClass
    public static void addExtensions() {
      System.setProperty("concordion.extensions", "nz.co.twoten.concordion.Extensions");
    }
</pre>
<p>The extensions may also be installed individually and have a number of customisation options. See the Javadoc of each extension for details.
To install multiple or customised extensions, supply a comma-separated list of extensions or extension factories in the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property.
