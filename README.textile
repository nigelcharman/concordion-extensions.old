h1. concordion-log-annotator

This is a "Concordion":http://concordion.org extension that annotates the Concordion HTML output with logging information. 

See "my blog":http://tutansblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/whats-happening-in-my-acceptance-tests.html for details and screenshots.

Currently the code is at a "Proof of Concept" stage, and any feedback is welcome.

Thanks to Trent Richardson for the "CSS Tooltip":http://trentrichardson.com/examples/csstooltips/ implementation.

This extension captures java.util.logging output. (It would probably benefit from some configuration options - feel free to provide feedback!)

It requires the new extension mechanism in Concordion. (This is currently in the nigel-charman branch of the Concordion source tree while we garner community feedback - you'll need to check out this branch and build it).

The extension is installed by setting the <code>concordion.extensions</code> system property to <code>nz.co.twoten.concordion.annotate.ConcordionLoggingAnnotator</code>.
